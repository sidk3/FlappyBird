# **Flappy Bird Game - Unity**

## **Overview**
Flappy Bird is a simple, yet addictive, 2D arcade game where you control a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes. The objective is to keep the bird in the air, avoiding obstacles, and try to achieve the highest score possible by flying through the gaps between pipes.

This version of the Flappy Bird game was developed using **Unity** and features intuitive controls and challenging gameplay. The bird automatically falls due to gravity, and the player must tap the screen to make it flap and rise temporarily. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances.

## **Features**
- **Flappy Bird Mechanics**: Tap the screen to make the bird flap and fly upward, while gravity causes it to fall.
- **Endless Gameplay**: The game continues as long as the bird does not collide with any pipes or the ground.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Pipes appear at varying heights with gaps for the bird to pass through. The gaps also change in size as the game progresses.
- **Score System**: The score increases each time the bird successfully flies through a pipe gap. The current score is displayed on the screen.
- **Game Over Screen**: The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground, and the final score is shown on the screen with an option to restart.

## **Controls**
- **PC / Web**: Press the space bar or click the mouse to make the bird flap and rise.
- **Mobile**: Tap anywhere on the screen to make the bird flap and rise.
